To add more python modules (espcially 3rd party ones), most people seem to use 
PYTHONPATH environment variables or they add symlinks or directories in their site-packages directories. 
Another way, is to use *.pth files. Here's the official python doc's explanation:

"The most convenient way [to modify python's search path] is to add a path configuration file to a directory 
that's already on Python's path, usually to the .../site-packages/ directory. 
Path configuration files have an extension of .pth, and each line must contain a single path 
that will be appended to sys.path. (Because the new paths are appended to sys.path, 
modules in the added directories will not override standard modules. 
This means you can't use this mechanism for installing fixed versions of standard modules.)"
